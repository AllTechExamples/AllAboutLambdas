All About Java 8 Lambdas Book Source Code

The project is a standalone Java project. Just import into your favourite IDE and start learning to code Java 8. Do note that you need Java 8 SDK required for compiling/running the code examples. Make sure you download the latest and great version of Java 8 as well as an IDE (I am currently using Eclipse MARS).
